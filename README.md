# Rust workshop

This is a repository to keep practicing the [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language and attempt problem solving and experimenting new mini projects.

The root directory structure is:

- `minigrep/`: _An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program_, see [rust-lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)
- `problems/`: _Problem solving project_, including various problems from different sources ([Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/), [rust-lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/))
